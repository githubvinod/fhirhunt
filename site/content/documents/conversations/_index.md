Subject: [FHIR Hunt Roadmap] ONC Interoperability Proving Ground<br />

Hi team, thanks to Abder-Rahman’s recent e-mail share, please see:<br />
ONC Interoperability Proving Ground<br />
https://www.healthit.gov/techlab/ipg/ 
We’ll need to integrate this somehow into FHIR Hunt – probably in Phase 2 or 3. Just like we connect with GitHub and other URLs, we should start with:<br />

* Tracking the IPG URL for a product/solution in case there is one (or more than one) 
    * For each product, we can tie it to projects where it’s in use or something similar
* See what data IPG is tracking and how we can track similar (they’re just using tags)
* Integrate with IPG APIs, if any

Ajay and Syed Umer … please discuss with me if you have questions – otherwise, just add it to the planning site.

Thanks,<br />
Shahid.

Hi Ajay – please read, study, and implement for FHIR Hunt:<br />

There are probably some libraries available but this approach seems simple enough.<br />
Thanks,<br />

Team, please see below – Razak please discuss with Ajay how we can add NEN like functionality into FHIR Hunt for curating digital health interoperability events. Then, talk with Radhika about how she can assist.

Thanks,<br />

    Interoperability Proving Ground (IPG) Spotlight
    The Interoperability Proving Ground (IPG) Spotlight project of the week is from Georgia Tech. The goal of this effort is to develop a proof of concept that would allow EMS to keep track of actions taken while transporting patients.
    
    Learn how your interoperability project can be featured as an IPG Spotlight by visiting the Interoperability Proving Ground. Once a project is submitted or updated, projects will automatically be added to the feature queue to be randomly selected as a featured project.

Hi Ajay, please add this to the roadmap:

“Watch” or “Subscribe” feature – similar to same feature in GitHub … being notified in case record changes.<br />
People can watch the entire site (e.g. RSS).<br />
People can watch specific products/solutions.

When anything is updated about a project, an email would go out.

NOTE: Don’t forget, after adding items to the roadmap please work on OKR based PM: https://herbigt.com/okr-product-management/

I see, OK – good to know that you’re QA’ing that capability.

Pittosh and team – let’s not make a huge mistake like this anymore :-)<br />
All week we’ve been working on less important things like allowing extra login support but didn’t even do the simplest thing a Product Hunt-like site should do, so please be sure to ask me priorities if there’s any confusion.

Submission, viewing, voting, and ranking are all important.

Radhika,

We have added the new About Us and the Categories. Apart from that we were doing a clean up for the custom fields and adding images for the newly added products. 

Team is also trying out few social login plugins that will allow GITHub, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook together in a single one and without a copy text from the author. We are trying the development activities on https://devl.fhirhunt.com/ and will move to production only if it works and looks good. 

Thank you,<br />
Ajay.

Hi Radhika,

The about page content is start but needs improvements – please see:<br />
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Hunt

We need to describe FHIR Hunt similar to the above.

The categories / tags are a good start. Please keep going (put them into a document) and we’ll organize it together this week.

Thanks,<br />

    Hi Shahid,

    Please find below my contributions towards the 'About us' content and a tiny little step towards categorizing products on FHIR Hunt.  

    I look forward to your inputs. 

    About us page: 

    FHIR Hunt is a sister concern of Netsepctive media that's curated and published by Shahid Shah<link to Shahid's LinkedIn/bio>. The best and recent Open source and commercially available solutions are surfaced on this site.  This is a perfect place for FHIR enthusiasts to share and discover dozens of the latest interoperable healthcare solutions on one convenient platform. 


    Categories: 

    I may be wrong, still exploring and in the learning process, please let me know if the categorization below makes sense. These are categorised at a superficial level based on the groups it benefits:

        Clinicians
            Open source 
                Training
                    Development
                    Implementation 
            Commercial
                Training
                    Development
                    Implementation 

    and the same Open source and commercial sub categorizations continue for patients, developers and healthcare providers. 

        Patients 
        Developers
        Healthcare providers/vendors 

    Thanks,
    Radhika

Also, please check why the heading (#3) is hidden. If that’s because we’re using two lines instead of one in the masthead, please reduce to one line.

Hi Ajay, 

I've purchased fhirhunt.com and am working with HL7 to create a new site that will do what I mentioned to the team in the thread below.

At your earliest opportunity:

1.	Setup a docker container of WordPress in Netspective DO Docker engine mounted on https://www.fhirhunt.com 
2.	Setup https://epicthemes.com/product/plugin-hunt-theme/ -- you guys should buy it and charge it to my bill … purchase it using a new alias epicthemes-admin@netspective.org tied to an existing group if necessary
3.	Create minor theming to with Netspective Media logos, etc.
4.	Install wpGraphQL for API access

Once it’s ready, either Gunjan or I will reach out to the HL7 team to help “seed” it with FHIR applications.<br />
Then, we may be asked to help create a simple catalog at http://www.fhir.org/ (coming later later).

Thanks,<br />
Shahid.

    If one of you (Chuck, Wayne, or Karen) is with Grahame in person and has 2 minutes to chat with him, it would be great to see if I can get verbal license approval to proceed with “FHIR Hunt” if possible – we can finish up the paperwork later. :-)
    
    Grahame – when you come up for air, we can finish the discussion we started on Saturday:

    Great, glad to hear it Chuck.
    
    I was thinking of using the “Community License” form but look forward to hearing back from the HL7 / FHIR team about how to proceed.
    
    My software strategy is ready and once I get the site up and running we can make a private announcement to all the FHIR Apps Roundtable participants to load up their summaries. That will make a launch later this month better since it will seem like it was good outcome of the Apps Roundtable, making a future Roundtable even better.
    
    Thanks,
    Shahid.

    Shahid,
    
    I'm absolutely in favor of such a website.
    
    Before you obtain the "FHIR Hunt" URL, please request copyright approval from Graham. At the moment, he is overwhelmed with demands of the WG meeting and the ballot of R4.
    
    Let's talk soon,
    Chuck

    Hi Karen – it was great catching up in DC and Baltimore last week, great work on the FHIR Apps Roundtable.
    
    As I mentioned on Saturday at the Hyatt, I am thinking of launching a new “FHIR Hunt” (perhaps www.fhirhunt.com) site which would let users share and discover new FHIR-related products and services. Users can submit FHIR-ish products which are listed in a linear format by day. The site would include a comments system and a voting system similar to Hacker News or Reddit. The FHIR related products with the most votes would rise to the top of each day's list.
    
    This would kind of like an online and real-time, continuously update, FHIR Apps Roundtable.
    
    Is this something that HL7 can help promote if I get it up and running? It would be owned and operated by Netspective Media but might be a great product for the community.
    
    Thanks,
    Shahid.
