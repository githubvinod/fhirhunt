## FHIR Hunt - Project Overview

### Objective

Create “FHIR Hunt” (www.fhirhunt.com) site that would let users share and discover new FHIR-related products and services.

### OKRs, KPIs and Methods

Need to list down.

### The idea revolves around software that does the following:

“FHIR Hunt” site (www.fhirhunt.com) will be an online and real-time, continuously update, FHIR Apps Roundtable, which will let users share and discover new FHIR-related products and services. Users can submit FHIR-ish products which are listed in a linear format by day. The site would include a comments system and a voting system similar to Hacker News or Reddit. The FHIR related products with the most votes would rise to the top of each day's list. It would be owned and operated by Netspective Media but might be a great product for the community.
